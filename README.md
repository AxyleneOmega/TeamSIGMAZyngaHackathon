### Scope of Meteor Crush
The Scope of a simple 2D Space Shooter can be quite focused with a limited number of features and mechanics. Elements of Meteor Crush that make it fun and enjoyable: 
* Player-Controlled Spaceship - The player's spaceship is the main character in the game. It can move left and right, fire weapons and collect power-ups. 
* Meteors - Players need to protect the spaceship from the meteors while smashing them to gain points. 
* Power-ups - Collecting power-ups enhances player abilities, like the multi-laser shot that gives the ability to fire multiple shots at once. Protection Shield provides protection to the spaceship from meteor damage for certain amount of time. Lastly, Spread Laser gives the spaceship the ability to fire 4 shots at once which are spread out, allowing it to kill more meteors at once. 
* Scoring system: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as they destroy and dodge meteors.
* Sound effects and music: The game features sound effects and background music to enhance the gameplay experience.

Meteor Crush can definitely be made a multiplayer game in the near future by adding more functionalities to the classic arcade theme, making it much more interactive and enjoyable for players of all age groups. 
* In the multiplayer version, different players both online and offline can compete with each other and a rank based system can be introduced for online players and for offline version players can invite their friends via codes and play together for fun.  
* The number of powerups can be increased giving more functionailty and addictie factor to the game. 
* Multiple levels can be itroduced, where the difficulty increases. 
* Different modes can be introduced like - arcade mode (simple version like the current), Competitive, Multi-laser etc.
